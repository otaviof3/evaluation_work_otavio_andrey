# Welcome to our College Project: Stock Management Software

This software is designed to facilitate the management of products available in a stock center. It provides information on product availability, price, category, amount sold, profit, and generates sales reports.

On this readme.md we'll see a complet break trought of the code. 

The program is divaided in 5 disincts parts, each one doing a part of the code, they're: Main.py, Menu.py, Sales.py, Stock.py and historic.py.

##MAIN.py

This is where the program is first initialized and contains important parts of the software, such as the declaration of the necessary variables and the sales report list. The program's menu functionalities are also located here.

##Menu.py
This is where the menu was coded, it conitians the 9 funcionalities of the programm: 
1 - Add a product.
2 - Alter product price
3 - Exclude a product.
4 - Changelog.
5 - Search a product.
6 - Search a category.
7 - View all products.
8 - Sell a product.
9 - Show sales report.
If the user types any other number the program will close.

##Sales.py
This is where sales transactions are processed. It prompts the user to input the product's name, quantity to be sold, and price. After the transaction is completed, it displays the total profit generated from the product sale.
This section also contributes to the sales report.

##Stock.py
It manages the overall stock of the stock center, allowing you to perform the following actions: add products, update product prices, remove products from the stock, search for a product by its name, search for products by category, and view the entire product inventory in the stock center.

##Historic
The final part of this powerful code. Here, you can access the transaction log in various ways, including tracking purchases, adding products, making edits, or simply generating a general report.

Feel free to look up the code yourself!
